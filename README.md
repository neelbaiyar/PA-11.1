## Analysis Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Explore and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Regression Modeling**:
   - Build multiple regression models to predict car prices based on features such as year, mileage, manufacturer, and model.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
3. **Interpretation**:
   - Interpret model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on used car prices.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Provide actionable recommendations to the client based on insights from the analysis.

## Key Findings
#### Findings
- Key factors influencing used car prices include car age (year) and mileage (odometer).
- Newer cars and those with lower mileage tend to have higher prices.
- Regression models provide insights into the used car dealership's pricing strategies and inventory management.

### Recommendations to the Client
